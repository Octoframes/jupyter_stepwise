 “Teaching and Learning with Jupyter” https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/catalogue.html shows notebook patterns that are useful for notebook exercises.

This repo can extend some of these practices.

One idea for "Fill in the blanks" is section wise notebooks, similar to the way this is done at brilliant, as can be seen in this screenrecodring:


Here are some ideas on how to fragment notebooks:

Low opactiy areas
-> TODO : find evidance that this is actually good.
-> TODO: make mock-up



How to deliver the notbook information more peacewise?

* Set low opacity to all sections that are not yet reaced by the stundent.
  * The sections that the student already worked on are full opacity.

* Hide all future sections completely, only show them when the button "Reveal Next Section" is pressed.
  * Also possible to reveal that next section by Command+Enter.

*
